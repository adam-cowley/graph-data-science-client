= Common datasets


For convenience, the library is shipped with a few common datasets.
These are easily imported to GDS to get a graph object representing the dataset.

The common datasets comes with a loader method that takes two optional parameters:
`graph_name` which assigns a graph name,
`undirected` which takes a boolean and will load the graph as undirected if set to true.

If a graph is loaded as `undirected = True`, then it will have twice the number of relationships compared to its directed version.
The default value for `undirected` varies for each dataset.

For example:
[source, python]
----
G = gds.graph.load_cora()

assert G.node_count() == 2_708
assert G.node_labels() == ["Paper"]
----


== Datasets

=== Cora
A well known citation network introduced by
https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009953814988[Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning]
and used in many node classification or link prediction https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora[publications].

The default is to load Cora as `undirected = False`.

| name                    | cora
| node_count              | 2_708
| relationship_count      | 5_429

| relationship_types      | ['CITES']

=== Karate club
A well known social network introduced by http://konect.cc/networks/ucidata-zachary/[Zachary].
The default is to load Karate club as `undirected = False`.

| Name                    | Value

| relationship_count      | 78
| node_labels             | ['Person']
| relationship_types      | ['KNOWS']
| node_properties         | Person: []
| relationship_properties | KNOWS: []

=== IMDB
A heterogeneous graph that is used to benchmark node classification or link prediction models such as
https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07293[Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network],
https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01680[MAGNN: Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding] and
https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06455[Graph Transformer Networks].
The graph contains Actors, Directors, Movies (and UnclassifiedMovies) as nodes, and relationships between actors and movies that they acted in,
and between directors and movies which they directed for.

The default is to load IMDB dataset as `undirected = True`. If loaded as directed, it will have half the relationships.
