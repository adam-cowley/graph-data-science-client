= The graph object

In order to utilize most the functionality in GDS, you must first project a graph into the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog].
When projecting a graph with the Python client, a client-side reference to the projected graph is returned.
We call these references `Graph` objects.

Once created, the `Graph` objects can be passed as arguments to other methods in the Python client, for example for running algorithms or training machine learning models.
Additionally, the `Graph` objects have convenience methods allowing for inspection of the projected graph represented without explicitly involving the graph catalog.

== Projecting a graph object

There are several ways of projecting a graph object.
The simplest way is to do a https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/projections/graph-project/[native projection]:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
# Suppose we have this simple graph in our database
gds.run_cypher(
  """
  CREATE
    (m: City {name: "MalmÃ¶"}),
    (l: City {name: "London"}),
    (s: City {name: "San Mateo"}),

    (m)-[:FLY_TO]->(l),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(m),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(s),
    (s)-[:FLY_TO]->(l)
  """
)

G, result = gds.graph.project(
    "offices",                  #  Graph name
    ["City"],                   #  Node projection
    "FLY_TO",                   #  Relationship projection
    readConcurrency=4           #  Configuration parameters
)

assert G.node_count() == result["nodeCount"]
----

where `G` is a `Graph` object, and `result` is a pandas `Series` containing metadata from the underlying procedure call.

Note that all projection syntax variants are supported by way of specifying a Python `dict` or `list` for the node and relationship projection arguments.
To specify configuration parameters corresponding to the keys of the procedure's `configuration` map, we give named keyword arguments, like for `readConcurrency=4` above.
Read more about this in https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-project/#graph-project-native-syntax[Syntax].

Similarly to Cypher there's also a corresponding `gds.graph.project.estimate` method that can be called in an analogous way.

To get a graph object that represents a graph that has already been projected into the graph catalog, one can call the client-side only `get` method and passing it a name:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
G = gds.graph.get("offices")
----

For users who are https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/administration/[GDS admins], `gds.graph.get` will resolve graph names into `Graph` objects also when the provided name refers to another user's graph projection.

In addition to those aforementioned there are four more methods that create graph objects:

* `gds.graph.project.cypher`
* `gds.beta.graph.subgraph`
* `gds.beta.graph.generate`
* `gds.alpha.graph.sample.rwr`

Their Cypher signatures map to Python in much the same way as `gds.graph.project` above.

== Constructing a graph

include::ROOT:partial$/alpha-note.adoc[]

Instead of projecting a graph from the Neo4j database it is also possible to construct new graphs using pandas `DataFrames` from the client.

[[graph-object-construct-example]]
[source,python,group=graph-roundtrip]
----
nodes = pandas.DataFrame(
    {
        "nodeId": [0, 1, 2, 3],
        "labels":  ["A", "B", "C", "A"],
        "prop1": [42, 1337, 8, 0],
        "otherProperty": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
    }
)

relationships = pandas.DataFrame(
    {
        "sourceNodeId": [0, 1, 2, 3],
        "targetNodeId": [1, 2, 3, 0],
        "relationshipType": ["REL", "REL", "REL", "REL"],
        "weight": [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 42.0]
    }
)

G = gds.alpha.graph.construct(
    "my-graph",      # Graph name
    nodes,           # One or more dataframes containing node data
    relationships    # One or more dataframes containing relationship data
)

assert "REL" in G.relationship_types()
----

The above example creates a simple graph using one node and one relationship `DataFrame`.
The created graph is equivalent to a graph created by the following Cypher query:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE
    (a:A {prop1: 42,    otherProperty: 0.1),
    (b:B {prop1: 1337,  otherProperty: 0.2),
    (c:C {prop1: 8,     otherProperty: 0.3),
    (d:A {prop1: 0,     otherProperty: 0.4),

    (a)-[:REL {weight: 0.0}]->(b),
    (b)-[:REL {weight: 0.0}]->(c),
    (c)-[:REL {weight: 0.1}]->(d),
    (d)-[:REL {weight: 42.0}]->(a),
----

The supported format for the node data frames is described in https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-project-apache-arrow/#arrow-node-columns[Arrow node schema] and the format for the relationship data frames is described in https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-project-apache-arrow/#arrow-relationship-columns[Arrow relationship schema].


[.enterprise-edition]
=== Arrow flight server support

The `construct` method can utilize the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/installation-apache-arrow/[Arrow Flight Server] of GDS if it's enabled.
This in particular means that:

* The construction of the graph is greatly sped up,
* It is possible to supply more than one data frame, both for nodes and relationships.
If multiple node dataframes are used, they need to contain distinct node ids across all node data frames.
* Prior to the `construct` call, a call to `GraphDataScience.set_database` must have been made to explicitly specify which Neo4j database should be targeted.

[[graph-object-load-cora]]
=== Loading the CORA dataset

For convenience, the library is shipped with the https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora[CORA dataset].
We can easily load it into GDS and get a graph object representing the dataset:

[source, python]
----
G = gds.graph.load_cora(graph_name="cora")

assert G.node_count() == 2708
assert G.node_labels() == ["Paper"] 
----


== Inspecting a graph object

There are convenience methods on the graph object that let us extract information about our projected graph.

|===

For example, to get the node count and node properties of a graph `G`, we would do the following:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
n = G.node_count()
props = G.node_properties("City")
----


== Using a graph object

The primary use case for a graph object is to pass it to algorithms, but it's also the input to most methods of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog].


=== Input to algorithms

The Python client syntax for using a `Graph` as input to an algorithm follows the GDS Cypher procedure API, where the graph is the first parameter passed to the algorithm.

include::ROOT:partial$/algorithm-syntax.adoc[]

In this example we run the degree centrality algorithm on a graph `G`:

[[graph-object-degree-example]]
[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
result = gds.degree.mutate(G, mutateProperty="degree")
assert "centralityDistribution" in result
----


=== The graph catalog

All procedures of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog] have corresponding Python methods in the client.
Of those catalog procedures that take a graph name string as input, their Python client equivalents instead take a `Graph` object, with the exception of `gds.graph.exists` which still takes a graph name string.

Below are some examples of how the GDS Graph Catalog can be used via the client, assuming we inspect the graph `G` from the <<graph-object-degree-example, example above>>:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
result = gds.graph.streamNodeProperty(G, node_properties="degree")

gds.graph.drop(G)  # same as G.drop()
----


[[graph-object-streaming-properties]]
==== Streaming properties

The client methods

* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-catalog-node-ops/[`gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamNodeProperty`)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-catalog-node-ops/[`gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamNodeProperties`)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-catalog-relationship-ops/[`gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty`)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-catalog-relationship-ops/[`gds.graph.relationshipProperties.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperties`)

are greatly sped up if https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/installation-apache-arrow/[Arrow Flight Server] of GDS is enabled.

Additionally, setting the client only optional keyword parameter `separate_property_columns=True` (it defaults to `False`) for `gds.graph.streamNodeProperties` and `gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperties` returns a pandas `DataFrame` in which each property requested has its own column.
Note that this is different from the default behavior for which there would only be one column called `propertyValue` that contains all properties requested interleaved for each node or relationship.


==== Streaming topology by relationship type

The type returned from the Python client method corresponding to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-catalog-relationship-ops/#_stream[`gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream`] is called `TopologyDataFrame` and inherits from the standard pandas `DataFrame`.
`TopologyDataFrame` comes with an additional convenience method named `by_rel_type` which takes no arguments, and returns a dictionary of the form `Dict[str, List[List[int]]]`.
This dictionary maps relationship types as strings to `2 x m` matrices where `m` here represents the number of relationhips of the given type.
The first row of each such matrix are the source node ids of the relationships, and the second row are the corresponding target node ids.

We can illustrate this transformation with an example using our graph `G` from the <<graph-object-construct-example, contruct example above>>:

[source,python, group=graph-roundtrip, min-server-version=2.2.0]
----
topology_by_rel_type = gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream(G).by_rel_type()

assert list(topology_by_rel_type.keys()) == ["REL"]
assert topology_by_rel_type["REL"][0] == [0, 1, 2, 3]
assert topology_by_rel_type["REL"][1] == [1, 2, 3, 0]
----

Like the <<graph-object-streaming-properties>> methods, the `gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream` is also accelerated if the GDS Arrow Flight Server is enabled.
